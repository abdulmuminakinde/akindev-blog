Peace be with you, digital nomads! I'm Abdulmumin.

Somewhere around 2022, I rerouted from pharmacy into software, trading prescriptions for pipelines, and I'm glad I did.

You can call me a terminal junkie and you will not be wrong.

I love to tinker with backend systems, APIs and the like.
Outside the shell, I consider myself a lover of books, write when I can, and always looking to feed my curiosity.
