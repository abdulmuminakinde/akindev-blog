_P.S: This is going to be unfiltered and unedited. It's a very rough draft but it should at least pass for a response_

I want to tell you things -- things that you know and others that you probably don't. Some of them you even deny or pretend you have no idea about however glaring. Like how you are pretttttaaayyyyyyy. But you already know that. _Visible to the deaf and audible to the blind. Beauty na water nowwww...lol_.

Like how you are one of the most dependable persons on the planet.

Like how you are the hardest working m'fker on the block. I meeann...nigga, you go out everyday to battle capitalism and still come back home to fight the cruel gods of job links. Most baffling is that you make it look like a walk in the park. So yeah, you are a m'fking force of the earth and I have absolutely zero doubt in your potential to blast through life.

You are kind. You are generous and you are a fierce lover. I think whoever you call a loved one is already leading life by 7 goals because you will go to the end of the earth just to make them happy. And that is becaude you are wired different. You are so incredible that you derive even more joy from making your loved ones joyful.

Before I go any further, I want to thank you. Thank you for existing. Thank you for loving this mess of a creation with all of his flaws. Honestly, I don't know what I did in my past life to deserve your love and friendship, but I hope I can replicate it again in this life so I can have you again in my next.

You take intentionality to a different height. You do things that make me wonder what exactly is going on in your head. _I'm honestly still interested in taking a peep inside that ori agbon🙏🏽._

Now, believe it or not, I write this with your fine smile plastered in my brain. The most recent one being the wide-eyed grin you let off when you saw I already had the peg you wanted. You see, sometimes I want my face to be a mirror just so you can experience your graciousness firsthand sometimes. I am honestly willing to do that for you. But I am also scared you will start charging before you interact with us, mere mortals. You know, when you realize you are on some goddess-level shi😄.

Not to sound like a broken record but there really isn't not a lot of things that is as beautiful when you let out this kind of smile from your big heart. Not when you are faking it. Not when you are trying to be nice and shake off an inconvenience. When the smile comes out impromptu from within your soul?? Dammit! Awe-mazing!

So, I want to thank you for the spirit-lifting text you sent me days back. I will continue to refer to the words. Thank you for the now uncountable unforgettable memories. Man, it's been really wild. Beautifully wild.
